# DataMineMe

The purpose of this repository is to keep track of stuff I read and watch. There
are multiple expectations for this effort:

* Eliminate that old problem of "hold on, I read an article on that once... [10
  minutes later] but I can't find it anymore."

* Make reading more active: stopping to record some key facts about an article
  offers a small moment of reflection on the contents.

* Data mining! Think of the possibilities: reading profiles, word clouds, track
  interests over time, automatically generated monthly summaries, article
  recommendations, etc. The possibilities are endless.
