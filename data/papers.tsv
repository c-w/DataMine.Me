Only consider non-zero elements of co-occurrence matrix in order to reduce noise. Not all training data is created equal: less in-domain data can outperform more out-of-domain data.

Interesting parts: using collaborative filtering for search re-ranking, quality of search snippet as a feature, trying to break the class-labels in the dataset up further. Hyper-parameter tuning was important.
