2014-08-11	http://tdunning.blogspot.com/2012/02/bayesian-bandits.html	Bayesian Bandits	Machine Learning	Mentions the concept of making exploration-time in bandit algorithms faster by factoring in the probability that each arm has of being the best so we don't waste time on arms that clearly have no chance of outperforming the others but still give some room to arms for which we merely don't have many observations: lack of evidence of success is not taken as evidence for failure.

2014-08-11	http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/time_varying_conversion_rates.html	How to measure a changing conversion rate (with python code)	Machine Learning	A/B tests, bandits, etc. assume that conversion rates are constant over time. Can relax this assumptions by using Jacobi diffusion instead (assume it's a random walk that approaches a constant).
2014-08-11	http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-run-an-ab-test.html	How Not To Run An A/B Test	Machine Learning	Repeated significance error: stopping an A/B test early because of seeing significant results needs a lot higher actually observed significance in order not to risk getting bad result. Either commit to an experiment sample size or use approximate formulae to find the smallest possible sample size by relating minimum change to be detected and expected data variance. Or we could just avoid this problem altogether by using Bayesian methods that will give us a best estimate at any point in time.
2014-08-11	http://camdp.com/blogs/machine-learning-counter-examples-pt1	Machine Learning Counterexamples Pt.1 - Discarding small coefficients in regression	Machine Learning	Small regression coefficients don't always imply low impact but can simply indicate correlated variables. Should validate before dropping features or just use a better model like ridge regression.

Supervised PCA fixes this.

2014-08-15	http://fastml.com/calibrating-a-classifier-with-isotonic-regression/	Calibrating a classifier with isotonic regression	Machine Learning	Classifier calibration: some classifiers output probabilities that are biased (e.g. SVM and boosted trees are conservative) - need to calibrate classifiers if we need exact probabilities. Platt's scaling: fit SVM, predic class labels, fit logistic regression using the SVM predictions as features and the true labels as targets. The probability values from the logistic regression are the calibrated SVM probabilities.

2014-08-20	http://blog.faroo.com/2012/06/07/improved-edit-distance-based-spelling-correction/	1000x Faster Spelling Correction algorithm	Natural Language Processing	Spell checking: two main approaches. Naive way: edit distance between word and all other words in dictionary. Very expensive. Can make somewhat better by terminating edit distance computation when greater than some threshold. Peter Norvig way is faster: generate all words with edit distance less then some threshold and look them up in the dictionary. Problem: language dependent (more expensive for languages with large alphabet). Better: symmetric deleting approach. Pre-processing step: for every word in dictionary, also add all the words that can be created with at most N deletions. At lookup time, generate terms with an edit distance less than some threshold from input term and look them up in dictionary. Language independent and three orders of magnitude faster than Norvig way.

2014-08-23	http://www.bayesimpact.org/blog/walking-the-beat.html	Walking the Beat: Mining Seattle's Police Report Data	Data Science	Worked example of a data analytics task (outlier detection on police report data). Important first step when analyzing a data-set: understand the data collection mechanism (is it biased towards a particular type of event or time?). If dealing with categorical variables, try using domain knowledge to bin them and reduce dimensionality. Can use regression (e.g. GLM) to model if differences in occurrences of categorical values are correlated to something. Can use coefficient deviation (standard deviation normalized by mean) to see if groups are still comparable even though they have very different means.

2014-08-27	https://plus.google.com/+YoshuaBengio/posts/GJY53aahqS8	Response to: Is Deep Learning the Final Frontier and the End of Signal Processing?	Machine Learning	Why does deep learning work? Distributed representation: every extra layer can represent an exponentially bigger family of functions because parameters can be reused: N parameters can be used to split 2^N input regions. Much more effective than non-distributed non-parametric learners like SVM or KNN.
2014-08-28	http://jeremykun.com/2014/08/26/when-greedy-algorithms-are-perfect-the-matroid/	When Greedy Algorithms are Perfect: the Matroid	Computer Science	Matroid is a set of independence systems I over X such that any non-maximally independent set can be grown by adding an element from a bigger independent set. If a problem can be formulated as a Matroid then a greedy algorithm will always be optimal.
2014-08-28	http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/03/11/frequentism-and-bayesianism-a-practical-intro/	Frequentism and Bayesianism: A Practical Introduction	Statistics	Frequentist approach treats probabilities as frequencies of events. Bayesian approach treats probabilities as notion of certainty of an event (prior knowledge + knowledge given observations). Advantage of Bayesian approach is that there is little need to change the model for more complicated problems (e.g. multi-dimensional or correlated data). Also doesn't make an implicit Gaussian assumption about the data or residuals. Drawback: overkill for simple problems.
2014-08-28	http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/06/06/frequentism-and-bayesianism-2-when-results-differ/	Frequentism and Bayesianism II: When Results Differ	Statistics	Nuisance parameter: something that we have to estimate in order to measure the quantity we are interested in but that isn't directly relevant to the question at hand. Bayesian approach marginalizes them out, frequentist approach uses a single maximum likelihood estimate (which is probably going to be wrong - there are ways to fix this, but Bayesian formulation does it for free). Bayesian approach also better deals with outliers by accounting for them using a nuisance parameter and integrating their effect out.
2014-08-29	http://firstround.com/article/What-I-Learned-As-Pandoras-First-Data-Scientist	What I Learned As Pandora's First Data Scientist	Data Science	It's important to have data scientists situated with the product teams - shorter feedback loops, closer to the product, can pitch in on the actual implementation, etc. For a data scientist manager it's important to pair up people with projects that interest them and make sure that there is enough mentoring or peer-learning going on.
2014-09-29	http://blog.lostpropertyhq.com/postgres-full-text-search-is-good-enough/	Postgres full-text search is Good Enough!	Natural Language Processing	Lots of information retrieval functionality is built into Postgres by default: stemming, spell-checking, TF-IDF vectorization, query ranking, multi-language support, stop-wording, etc. This means we don't need to break out ElasticSearch for smaller scale full-text search.
2014-09-29	http://blog.notdot.net/2010/07/Damn-Cool-Algorithms-Levenshtein-Automata	Damn Cool Algorithms: Levenshtein Automata	Natural Language Processing	There is a way to construct finite state automata that compute the edit distance between two strings. This means that we can compute edit distance in linear time (plus some one-time overhead to construct the automata).
