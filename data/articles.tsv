2014-08-11	http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=132	20 lines of code that will beat A/B testing every time	Machine Learning	Simple description of bandit algorithms (epsilon-greedy learning) as applied to multiple-hypothesis A/B testing.
2014-08-11	http://tdunning.blogspot.com/2012/02/bayesian-bandits.html	Bayesian Bandits	Machine Learning	Mentions the concept of making exploration-time in bandit algorithms faster by factoring in the probability that each arm has of being the best so we don't waste time on arms that clearly have no chance of outperforming the others but still give some room to arms for which we merely don't have many observations: lack of evidence of success is not taken as evidence for failure.
2014-08-11	http://streetpickup.hubpages.com/hub/Do-AB-Testing-the-right-way-Bayesian-bandits	Do A/B Testing the right way: Bayesian bandits	Machine Learning	Relates the Bayesian bandit to the Beta distribution, including probability update formula and shows the progression of likelihood of pull each arm over time.

2014-08-11	http://camdp.com/blogs/multi-armed-bandits	The Multi-Armed Bandit Problem	Machine Learning	How to measure bandit performance (expected regret) and extensions to the model: learning rates to adapt to changes in world faster, hierarchies of bandits in order to try out different parameters like learning rates.
2014-08-11	http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2012/bandit_algorithms_vs_ab.html	Why Multi-armed Bandit algorithms are superior to A/B testing	Machine Learning	UCB1 algorithm: introduce the use of confidence in bandit learning by estimating the best possible true mean of each arm and choosing the arm that maximizes this quantity.
2014-08-11	http://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/time_varying_conversion_rates.html	How to measure a changing conversion rate (with python code)	Machine Learning	A/B tests, bandits, etc. assume that conversion rates are constant over time. Can relax this assumptions by using Jacobi diffusion instead (assume it's a random walk that approaches a constant).
2014-08-11	http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-run-an-ab-test.html	How Not To Run An A/B Test	Machine Learning	Repeated significance error: stopping an A/B test early because of seeing significant results needs a lot higher actually observed significance in order not to risk getting bad result. Either commit to an experiment sample size or use approximate formulae to find the smallest possible sample size by relating minimum change to be detected and expected data variance. Or we could just avoid this problem altogether by using Bayesian methods that will give us a best estimate at any point in time.
2014-08-11	http://camdp.com/blogs/machine-learning-counter-examples-pt1	Machine Learning Counterexamples Pt.1 - Discarding small coefficients in regression	Machine Learning	Small regression coefficients don't always imply low impact but can simply indicate correlated variables. Should validate before dropping features or just use a better model like ridge regression.
2014-08-11	http://camdp.com/blogs/machine-learning-counterexamples-pt2-post-pca-regr	ML Counterexamples Pt.2 - Regression Post-PCA	Machine Learning	Blindly dropping dimensions with low PCA-eigenvalues can harm performance if the lower-valued dimensions correlate highly with the attribute to be predicted. Supervised PCA fixes this.

2014-08-15	http://fastml.com/calibrating-a-classifier-with-isotonic-regression/	Calibrating a classifier with isotonic regression	Machine Learning	Classifier calibration: some classifiers output probabilities that are biased (e.g. SVM and boosted trees are conservative) - need to calibrate classifiers if we need exact probabilities. Platt's scaling: fit SVM, predic class labels, fit logistic regression using the SVM predictions as features and the true labels as targets. The probability values from the logistic regression are the calibrated SVM probabilities.

2014-08-20	http://blog.faroo.com/2012/06/07/improved-edit-distance-based-spelling-correction/	1000x Faster Spelling Correction algorithm	Natural Language Processing	Spell checking: two main approaches. Naive way: edit distance between word and all other words in dictionary. Very expensive. Can make somewhat better by terminating edit distance computation when greater than some threshold. Peter Norvig way is faster: generate all words with edit distance less then some threshold and look them up in the dictionary. Problem: language dependent (more expensive for languages with large alphabet). Better: symmetric deleting approach. Pre-processing step: for every word in dictionary, also add all the words that can be created with at most N deletions. At lookup time, generate terms with an edit distance less than some threshold from input term and look them up in dictionary. Language independent and three orders of magnitude faster than Norvig way.
