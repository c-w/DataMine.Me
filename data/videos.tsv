2014-08-06	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_fZNQM-2o4	Measuring Similarity & Clustering Data	Machine Learning	K-means clustering: run multiple times to approach global optimum, does not work well if variance is uneven in different dimensions (assumes spherical data), works well in presence of redundant dimensions but breaks down with noise, distance in high dimensions is not meaningful, use silhouette score for evaluation (ratio of distance to cluster center to all other centroids). Spectral clustering: looks for close-by points that are not close to other points. Construct similarity graph of points, find graph Laplacian, eigenvalue decomposition, take smallest eigenvectors and run K-means in there => increases performance.
