2014-08-04	http://columbia-applied-data-science.github.io/appdatasci.pdf	Applied Data Science	Data Science	Gentle introduction to basic data science concepts. The section on out-of-bag estimation for training of multiple classifiers on small amounts of data was interesting.
2014-08-05	http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002RMSZ7E/	Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman	Software Engineering	Very succinct and plainly written. Preaches nothing radically novel - if you've read The Pragmatic Programmer, The Mythical Man Month, Code Complete or other similar books you probably won't find many new ideas here. Being more to-the-point than any of the other tomes, the book would however make an excellent first foray into software craftsmanship.
2014-08-13	www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00HJUBRPG/	Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability	Design	Short and a pleasure to read. Most of the topics covered shouldn't come as a surprise, but the book is a good way of bringing the most important web-design considerations back into active memory.
2014-08-29	http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00B8V09HY/	Effective Java: Second Edition	Software Engineering	Not as mind-blowing as on its first read through, but still lots of good stuff. The first few chapters are a good general read and reminder of some of the important things when writing software. The later chapters (concurrency, serialization, etc.) make for good reference material.
2014-09-28	http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00DY5A8X2/	Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams	Management	More of a hand-book for managers than a book about management. Lots of good, common sense advise about the day-to-day of building teams and running projects... But not very useful for non-manager types.
2014-10-25	http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0132350882/	Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship	Software Engineering	Lots of good stuff in here about low level things that make code readable. The writing is quite entertaining. Most importantly, the book has lots of examples that make it easy to relate to the concepts that the author is trying to communicate. However, most (if not all) of the stuff in here is very basic and should already be known to anyone who has been writing software professionally for any amount of time. The book probably is a great resource for someone about to start an internship, but beyond that, I question its value.
2014-11-30	http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0978739213/	Release It!: Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software	Software Engineering	This book was a real mixed bag. On one hand, a lot of the advice in the book seemed quite technology specific and will probably be out-of-date sooner rather than later. On the other hand, there was a lot of good stuff in here about how to build robust and failure-tolerant systems and architecture. Just being aware of the patterns and failure-modes that the book talks about made me think differently about my day-to-day work. This is one to be re-visited further down the road of the software developer journey.
