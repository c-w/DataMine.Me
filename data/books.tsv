2014-08-05	http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002RMSZ7E/	Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman	Software Engineering	Very succinct and plainly written. Preaches nothing radically novel - if you've read The Pragmatic Programmer, The Mythical Man Month, Code Complete or other similar books you probably won't find many new ideas here. Being more to-the-point than any of the other tomes, the book would however make an excellent first foray into software craftsmanship.
